                        Andarduft, which translates to &quot;ancient scent,&quot; has been a part of Icelandic folklore for centuries. According to legend, trolls would gather this plant under the moonlight, believing it held the power to soothe the soul and invigorate the spirit. The plant&apos;s refreshing minty taste and invigorating aroma made it a favorite among these mythical creatures, who used it to enhance their well-being and connect with the natural world.
